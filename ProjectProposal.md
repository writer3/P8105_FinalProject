## Tentative Project Title

*Connecting Political Views and Health Metrics*

## Project Motivation

The motivation of this project is to understand how health metrics
correlate to past presidential election results. This might uncover
trends in whether populations with better health outcomes tend to vote
in certain ways. Perhaps trends are more apparent in certain counties,
which may suggest that while health outcomes do not *cause* political
views, they do correlate with other factors, such as socioeconomic
factors.

## Intented Final Products and Planned Analysis & Visualizations

This project would seek to answer whether the average health of a county
correlates with political views. Possible ideas for final products to
answer this question include tables and graphs that slice datasets in
different ways. For example, starting with a scatter plot of a specific
health metric versus percentage of vote for a certain party, we can look
at: \* variations with time, such as the past 3 presidential elections
\* separated counties into high-income and low-income \* look at the
differences between rural and urban

In addition, we can consider confounding variables, such as household
income, employment rates, education, etc. For instance, this might
involve scatterplots of each of these confounding variables with the
health metrics, and then with the election results. This would uncover
whether these are indeed confounding.

## Anticipated Data Sources

For information on health outcomes by county and by year, we can use
information from this source:
<https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/methodology-and-sources/data-documentation>

For data on election results by county and by year, we can consult the
MIT election datasets: <https://electionlab.mit.edu/data>

## Coding Challenges

A potential challenge that may arise is matching different datasets
together because county name is not a unique identifier. We may need
multiple look-up tables to find unique matches, such as by looking at
both state and county name, or by looking at zip code and county.

## Planned Timeline

- Week 1 (Nov 9 to Nov 15): Preliminary data wrangling (cleaning,
  manipulation)
- Week 2 (Nov 16 to Nov 22): Drafting what specific plots and analysis
  to include based on preliminary visualization
- Week 3 (Nov 23 to Nov 29): Final visualization and EDA
- Week 4 (Nov 30 to Dec 6): Creating final deliverables (website,
  screencast, etc.)
