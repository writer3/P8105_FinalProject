<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is emulate an <em>ecological</em> study in
order to understand and visualize the relationship between political
trends and outcomes on county-level public health in the United States.
Specifically, we are interested in the potential correlations between a
variety of health metrics and presidential election results in both 2012
and 2016. By understanding the relationship between these data, this
project aims to understand sociopolitical and socioeconomic implications
for health and wellbeing at a county level, and offer insights into
patterns that may offer recommendations for broader application.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this project comes from a growing body of
scientific literature aimed at understanding how health transforms as
the sociopolitical climate shifts.</p>
<p>For example, Salas-Guerra’s 2021 multivariate correlational analysis
of four U.S states (California, New York, Texas, and Florida)
investigated political affiliation and viral contagion/mortality from
COVID-19. Findings indicated poverty and lack of insurance as a main
risk factor for the COVID contagion in Republican states (Salas-Guerra,
2021).</p>
<p>Other studies such as Bor’s 2017 study “<em>Diverging Life
Expectancies and Voting Patterns in the 2016 US Presidential
Election</em>” examined voting patterns and life expectancy at the
county level. Main findings included voting patterns undermining the
overall health of the voter; that is, a pattern was detected of
residents who voted for Trump or didn’t vote at all in 2016 and were
most likely to be residents of counties that experienced not only
economic insecurity but decreased public health indicated by higher
mortality rates (Bor 2017).</p>
<p>Curtis et al.’s 2021 study “<em>Life expectancy and voting patterns
in the 2020 U.S presidential election</em>” came to similar conclusions
leveraging county-level life expectancy data and voting data scraped
from news outlets. Specifically, they found that despite large shifts
towards Democratic candidates, communities that were most impacted by
lower life expectancy and lower health tended to vote Republican (Curtis
et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The results of these studies indicate a key point of interest related
to what communities choose to vote for compared to what those
implications on their health are. Our project aims to add to this body
of data analysis with a specific focus on health indicators like
premature death, preventable hospital stays, number of physicians
geographically, and flu vaccinations.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>Our main research question is: how do national and county level
bipartisan voting patterns impact key health indicators (premature
death, preventable hospital stays, number of physicians, and vaccination
status) in 2012 and 2016. Our original research question was interested
in assessing this relationship from 2000-2020, however we chose to
constrain our data to using only 2012 and 2016 data after conducting
early data wrangling and exploratory analyses that identified this set
of time as having the most robust dataset available to appropriately
assess our relationship of interest. Additionally, this date range
(2012-2016) is of particular public health interest, as the decades long
trend of increased life expectancy between 1959 and 2016 started to
noticeably slow down after 2014 (Woolf and Schoomaker, 2019).</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>For information on health outcomes by county and by year, we used
information from this source: <a
href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/methodology-and-sources/data-documentation"
class="uri">https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/methodology-and-sources/data-documentation</a></p>
<p>For data on election results by county and by year, we consulted the
MIT election datasets: <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/data"
class="uri">https://electionlab.mit.edu/data</a></p>
<p>We started by cleaning the <code>election</code> dataset, which
contains information such as county name, state, year, party, and total
votes. The mutate function was used to calculate the percentage of
votes. The common variable <code>year_county</code> was used to uniquely
match the data for a given year and county FIPS code.</p>
<p>We identified four measures that are the most robust in the datasets:
<code>Premature death</code>, <code>Preventable hospital stays</code>,
<code>Primary care physicians</code>, and <code>Flu vaccinations</code>,
and filtered for these four measurements. Since these measurements have
different units and scales, we standardize each variable to improve
visualization and statistical analysis. This means that for each health
metric, a value of zero means the average, and each unit represents one
standard deviation away. For example, a <code>premature_death</code>
value of 1 means that county has a premature death rate that is one
standard deviation higher than the average county.</p>
<p>Here we join the <code>election</code> and <code>health</code>
datasets by a common variable <code>year_county</code>. Through our
exploratory analysis, we found that years 2012 and 2016 had the least
amount of missing data, hence we filter for data for these years. Then
we remove the outliers for each measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>We first started by exploring each dataset individually. For the
<code>election</code> data, a plot was made comparing the county vote
share for <code>democrat</code> and for <code>republican</code>. It was
observed that in many counties, the sum of the <code>democrat</code> and
<code>republican</code> percents do not add to 1, which indicates the
presence of third-parties. That being said, the graph below shows
there’s a limit where no points are above the line <span
class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>. This makes sense because the vote
share in a specific county cannot exceed 100%.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Next, we considered how the four health variables under investigation
are related to each other. This was important to make sure they are all
independent from each other. In general, there is largely random
distribution of points, so there is no clear pattern. However, the
relationship between <code>premature_death</code> and
<code>preventable_hospital_stays</code> does suggest a positive
correlation. Counties with higher premature death rates also seem to
have more preventable hospital stays, which makes sense because a
premature death means by definition that it was a preventable death.
There also seems to be a negative correlation between
<code>premature_death</code> and <code>flu_vaccinations</code>. With
greater flu vaccinations, we observe fewer premature deaths.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now, we began to look at the correlation between election results and
these four health metrics. For simplicity, the outcome or response
variable was chosen to be the <code>republican</code> vote share.
However, as we demonstrated above, this is negatively correlated with
the <code>democrat</code> vote share.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a lot of random scatter and a clear pattern is
hard to justify. However, some interesting observations are the positive
correlations between <code>physicians</code> and <code>republican</code>
vote share. There also seems to be a negative correlation between
<code>flu_vaccinations</code> and <code>republican</code> vote
share.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<div id="geographic-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Geographic Plots</h3>
<p>We also decided to include maps as part of the exploratory analysis.
The plots below show the nationwide county-level vote share. The darker
blue represents higher <code>democrat</code> vote share. The darker red
represents higher <code>republican</code> vote share. As expected, these
are inversely related - that is, a darker blue area would also be
lighter red. To improve comparability, the scales are fixed so that the
same shade of blue, for example, means the same thing between the two
years. We noticed that when going from 2012 to 2016, the map became a
lot lighter blue, reflecting the decrease in the democrat popular vote
from 2012 to 2016. Note: Alaska was removed due to a different way of
assigning counties, and thus Hawaii was also removed so that we only
considered the contiguous US.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>While the intention was to look at nationwide correlations, we
realized that there are many factors that influence voting across an
entire country. It is also more difficult to identify trends in large
heterogeneous populations. Therefore, we decided to also zoom in on New
York state. We also observed that from 2012 to 2016, the state became
lighter blue and darker red.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Next, we considered the geographic distributions of the health
metrics. It would be difficult to see trends across the entire US, so
instead, we are only looking at New York state.</p>
<p>There does not seem to be a clear pattern for
<code>premature_death</code>, as some counties became lighter whereas
others became darker.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The <code>physicians</code> rate in each county appears to stay
roughly constant when going from 2012 to 2016.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>At first glance, it seems that there were fewer
<code>preventable_hospital_stays</code> in 2016 compared to 2012.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Further, <code>flu_vaccinations</code> seems to have stayed roughly
constant from 2012 to 2016.</p>
<p><img src="FinalReport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p>Next, we conducted a series of multiple linear regressions to
quantify the effect of the health metrics on the <code>republican</code>
vote share. There were a total of six regressions: the US for both
years, the US for 2012, the US for 2016, NY state for both years, NY
state for 2012, and NY state for 2016. The estimates for the
coefficients and the corresponding R2 values are summarized in the
tables below. Note that while not all estimates were significant, most
were at the 5% level. These numbers will be further discussed in the
next section.</p>
